## Arthimetic Operators

- (+) Addition
- (-) Subtraction
- (*) Multiplication
- (/) Division
- (%) Mod (the remainder after dividing)
- (**) Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)
- (//) Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer

The usual order of mathematical operations holds in Python, often referred to as 
PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

If needed, you can review the order of mathematical operations in this Wikipedia article Order of Operations.

Bitwise operators are special operators in Python that you can learn more about here if you'd like.

### Quiz Question
```
print((17 - 6))
```
Which of these lines of Python code are well formatted? How would you improve the readability of the codes that don't use good formatting? (Choose all that apply)


## Variables I
```
mv_population = 747728
```
## Variables II
```
x = 3
y = 4
z = 5
```
and 
```
x, y, z = 3, 4, 5
```
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Correct way of Variables
```
my_height = 58
my_lat = 40
my_long = 105
```
### Incorrect way of Variables
```
my Height = 58
MYLONG = 40
My_Lat = 105
```
